        Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade chicken biryani:
        <ul>
            <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) according to manufacturerâ€™s instructions.</li>
            <li>Place chicken tenders in a large bowl. Add olive oil, garlic powder, paprika, parsley flakes, salt, and pepper. Toss to coat. Add grated Parmesan cheese. Toss to coat until evenly combined.</li>
            <li>Thread a tender on to each skewer and place each skewer in the basket of the air fryer in an even layer. They can touch, but should not overlap</li>
            <li>Cook for 7 minutes. Flip skewers and cook until chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run clear, about 3 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the center of chicken should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ul>
